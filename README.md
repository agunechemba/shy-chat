# 🤫 shyChat

Imagine a secret clubhouse on the internet where friends can talk and share files **without a boss server watching over them**. That’s exactly what **shyChat** is.

shyChat is a **lightweight, serverless, peer-to-peer (P2P) group messaging app** that runs right inside your web browser. It uses a clever technology called **WebRTC**, which lets browsers talk directly to each other. This means your messages and files **never pass through a central server**. Fast, private, and cool 😎.

## 🚀 What Makes shyChat Special?

### 🌐 Serverless Mesh Networking  
There is no main server in charge. Every person in the room helps pass messages along, like friends standing in a circle whispering to each other. If one friend hears something, everyone else can too.

### 🔒 Privacy Comes First  
No accounts.  
No databases.  
No tracking.  

Your identity is temporary—when the room closes, it’s gone like chalk on a board after class.

### 📁 Direct File Sharing  
Want to send a picture or document? Files travel **straight from your browser to your friend’s browser**, using fast data channels. No middleman involved.

### 📱 Responsive Design  
Whether you’re on a phone, tablet, or computer, shyChat adjusts itself to fit perfectly. Smooth, modern, and easy to use.

### ⚡ Instant Rooms  
One click creates a room.  
One link invites friends.  

No sign-ups, no waiting.

## 💡 Running shyChat on Your Computer

Getting started is super easy:

1. Clone or download the `index.html` file  
2. Open it in any modern web browser  
3. That’s it—no setup, no installs, no commands

⚠️ **Important Note**  
shyChat uses WebRTC, which needs a **STUN server** to help browsers find each other through firewalls. The project already includes a Google STUN server in the code, so everything works automatically.
